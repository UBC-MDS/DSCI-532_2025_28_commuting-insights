## Motivation and purpose

The Canadian federal government is facing a critical challenge in addressing the growing concerns about transportation efficiency, environmental impact, and the quality of life for residents. One of the most pressing issues is the high dependency on cars for commuting, which not only leads to longer commute times but also contributes significantly to elevated CO2 emissions. This, in turn, exacerbates climate change, with widespread social, economic, and environmental consequences. As urbanization continues to spread across the country, understanding commuting patterns on a national scale has become essential for developing effective policies.

The purpose of this project is to assist the Canadian federal government by providing a comprehensive comparison of commuting patterns across all regions of Canada. This analysis will focus on the relationship between car dependency and commute times, aiming to identify trends that can inform national transportation policies. By examining the proportion of commutes made by car and the average commute times across the country, the project seeks to highlight regions where car dependency is particularly high, which may contribute to longer commute times and higher environmental impacts.

Through this comparison, the project will provide insights into how different regions across Canada are performing in terms of transportation efficiency and sustainability. This information will support the development of policies and infrastructure investments that aim to reduce car dependency, mitigate CO2 emissions, and improve overall commuting efficiency, benefiting residents nationwide.
